## Description
Leetspeak uses an alternative alphabet of numbers and symbols to replace various letters in words. For example, "leet" becomes "1337" and "Epicodus" might become "3p1c0duz".

This application uses Ruby to write a method that converts a string using some of the rules of Leetspeak: 
* The letter "e" should be replaced with "3".
* The letter "o" should be replaced with "0".
* The capital letter "I" (but not the lower case, "i") should be replaced with "1".
* All instances of "s" should be replaced with "z" UNLESS it is the first letter of the word.
